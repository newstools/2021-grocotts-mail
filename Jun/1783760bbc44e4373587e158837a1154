The Electoral Commission has welcomed the decision of the Electoral Court to postpone eight by-elections scheduled for today Wednesday 30 June 2021.
The Electoral Court this morning authorised the postponement of the by-elections for a period not exceeding 120 days from the date of the order. The Court also granted the Electoral Commission leave to approach the Court for further relief should it be necessary.

The Electoral Commission said it would continue to assess the prevailing conditions including the level and scope of restrictions imposed in terms of the Disaster Management Act to determine an appropriate date for the by-elections to be held. “The Electoral Commission will engage with the relevant provincial MECs for Cooperative Governance other key stakeholders including political parties and candidates who are registered to contest the by-elections in this regard,” spokesperson Kate Bapela said. Today’s by-elections were to have taken place in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu–Natal, Northern Cape and Western Cape across 48 voting stations and involving 713052 registered voters.
