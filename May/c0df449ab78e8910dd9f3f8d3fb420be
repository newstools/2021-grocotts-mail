The special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant ended on 30 April 2021; however the SA Social Security Agency (SASSA), which manages social grants, said it had noticed that some unpaid but approved applicants were panicking and as a result were gathering at post offices requesting payment. “All such applicants of the special Covid-19 SRD grant, who have been approved but not yet paid can rest assured that the will be paid as soon as possible,” SASSA said in a statement. The agency confirmed that payment would be made for all approved grants as soon as confirmation of funding has been made. “These payments are from the previous financial year,” SASSA said. As part of the government measures to prevent and combat the spread of Covid-19, SASSA was mandated to provide the special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress Grant from May 2020 to October 2020 initially, and further extended to January 2021 and April 2021 respectively. “Even after the grant has ended, payments will be made to those deserving approved clients,” the Agency said. “The payment may not necessarily come as a double payment or lump sum or on the same day. It can be split over days or weeks. “SASSA wishes to unreservedly apologise to all unpaid clients of the special Covid-19 SRD grant for any inconvenience this may have caused.”
